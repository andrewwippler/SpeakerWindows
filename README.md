# Speaker Windows

A complete rewrite of [Speaker-Illustrations](https://github.com/andrewwippler/speaker-illustrations).

Speaker Windows is a personal, searchable repository of illustrations which are categorized by tags. This is a replacement to paper, word doc folder, and evernote/onenote notebook filing systems.

The project aims to have an testable API which allows the use of multiuser authentication, sharing of illustrations, and browser extension to easily add illustrations.
